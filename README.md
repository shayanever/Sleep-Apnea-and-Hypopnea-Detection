Sleep apnea and hypopnea are prevalent sleep disorders
with significant health implications. Accurately identifying
these disorders is essential for effective diagnosis and treatment.
In this study, we propose a new approach to pinpoint the specific
features of each signal that have the greatest impact on detecting
sleep apnea and hypopnea. By using a random forest algorithm
and SHAP analysis, we examined the St. Vincentâ€™s University
Hospital dataset, which includes overnight PSG and ECG signals
from patients suspected of having sleep-disordered breathing. We
extracted time and frequency domain features from the signals,
capturing diverse characteristics that indicate sleep apnea and
hypopnea. These features were fed into the random forest model.
Subsequently, SHAP analysis was employed to unveil the most
influential features in the recognition process. The identified key
features offer valuable insights into the underlying physiological
characteristics and mechanisms associated with sleep apnea and
hypopnea. This knowledge opens avenues for improved diagnostic
approaches and personalized treatment strategies. Our study underscores
the potential of combining machine learning algorithms
with interpretability techniques to advance our understanding of
sleep disorders.
